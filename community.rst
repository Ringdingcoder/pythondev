    *Come for the Language, Stay for the Community*
    -- `Brett Cannon (and Naomi Ceder) <https://twitter.com/brettsky/status/764862972468408320>`_

    *Pull requests can be like someone trying to give you a puppy you didn't
    ask for; they mean well, but they can forget a puppy is a decade-or-more
    commitment and you just don't like the puppy.*
    -- `Brett Cannon <https://twitter.com/brettsky/status/958511462300884992>`_

    *Maintaining an open-source project is like being a Flight Attendant for an
    airline where all tickets are free and the majority of customer surveys
    offer suggestions on how to fly the airplane.*
    -- `Kelsey Hightower <https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower/status/958349496076742658>`_

    *Having a great language is... great, but having a community around it gives you a sense of belonging, which is one of the most basic instincts and desires we have as animals.*
    -- Sawyer X (Perl 5 maintainer), `Pragmatic Perl Interviews <http://pragmaticperl.com/interviews-book/download.html>`_, May 2013

    *"When you choose a language, you're choosing more than a set of technical
    trade-offs-you're choosing a community."*
    -- `Joshua Bloch <https://twitter.com/CodeWisdom/status/976452643173302274>`_.
    ("Coders at Work: Reflections on the Craft of Programming". Book by Peter
    Seibel, 2009.)

Work In Progress
================

* `Getting along in the Python community <https://lwn.net/Articles/757714/>`_
  by Guido van Rossum and Brett Cannon (May 2018):

  When someone is having an emotional response to a post, they should wait to
  respond. Guido: *"Sitting on your hands is often a good response"*.

* Reserve easy issues to non-core developers: `[python-committers] Please stop
  fixing easy issues right now! Leave them as exercices to newcomes
  <https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-committers/2017-June/004564.html>`_

  * `Core developer promoted <https://github.com/vstinner/misc/blob/master/cpython/mentor_core_dev_email.rst>`_

Ideas
=====

* Organize mentoring? Make it public? List documentations for mentors?
* Django CoC: procedure to report abuse
* Thanks.Python.org - clone of https://thanks.rust-lang.org/ but with snakes üêç
  and even cuter emojis!
* Tooling to detect active contributors: number of commits, emails, reviews,
  etc. Is it doable?
* Statistics on GitHub reviews:

  * https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/reviews/#list-reviews-on-a-pull-request
  * https://github.com/joacim-boive/github-statistics # Chrome extension

* gamification: public top 5?

  * The idea is to motivate the contributors: one way is "self-motivation"
    (i.e. streak counter, daily/weekly/monthly goals, etc). Another is
    "multiplayer" (e.g. leaderboards and other "competitive" aspects).
  * Give badges depending on the number of posted bugs, PR, emails, etc.?
  * https://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/

* Bot to thanks automatically new contributors with cute emojis? "Congrats üôå
  for your first PR merged into CPython üêç!" (do email notifications like
  emojis?)
* Create subteams:

  * IDLE
  * asyncio
  * Documentation
  * Windows
  * Workgroup Community // core-workflow
  * XXX: need a bot on GitHub to restrict permissions to files/directories?

* Missing in action: drop core dev for inactive developers?
