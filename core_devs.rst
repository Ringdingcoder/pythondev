What is a CPython Core Developer?
=================================

Video of Mariatta Wijaya's talk: "What is a Python Core Developer?" (Pycon US
2018): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhj7eb6TrtI

How to increase the number of core developers?
==============================================

`Guido van Rossum, June 2018
<https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-committers/2018-June/005519.html>`_
about the low number of active core developers:

    The best course of action seems to be to take measures to acquire new
    committers (and contributors), not to try and reactivate old inactive
    committers.

* :ref:`Mentoring <mentoring>`
* Write less code, spend more time on reviews and mentoring
