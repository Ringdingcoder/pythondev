    penalized and branded as non-technical. Some women chose not to speak out
    because of this. We will not be silenced."*

First issue: become aware of diversity issues
=============================================

Usually, people involved since a long time in a project and who are in the
short priviledged group (ex: "core reviewers" or "core developers"), are not
aware of diversity issue. If there is no issue, who should anyone care of
diversity?

**Unconscious Bias** can be a first hint.

Issues with speaker diversity in tech conference

  (April 20, 2018):

    Trying not to do any community engagement this month, but this is such high
    priority, and I can't stay silent. I'm so utterly heartbroken and
    disappointed to find out that there is a PyCon someplace 2018, and that it
    has 22 all male speaker lineup.

Diversity Statement:

    The Python Software Foundation and the global Python community welcome and
    encourage participation by everyone. Our community is based on mutual
    respect, tolerance, and encouragement, and we are working to help each
    other live up to these principles. We want our community to be more
    diverse: whoever you are, and whatever your background, we welcome you.

  (June, 2018)

For example, don't say "hey *guys*!" or "fellas" but "hey **everyone**!", forks
or "y'all": see `heyguys.cc <https://heyguys.cc/>`_.

Comment template:

     In the future please use gender-neutral words such as "folks" and "y'all"
     instead of "guys". Thanks.

Being a Woman on the Internet

Stories unrelated to Python, or not directly related to the Internet. Its more
to have an idea of the general idea of harassement on the Internet.
